Module introduction:

This module is designed based on the principle of resistance voltage division, which can reduce the input voltage of terminal interface by 5 times. The analog input voltage of Arduin is 5V, so the input voltage of the voltage detection module should not be greater than 5V x5= 25V (if the 3.3V system is used, the input voltage should not be greater than 3.3Vx5=16.5V). Because the AVR chip used by Arduino is a 10-bit AD, the analog resolution of this module is 0.00489V (5V/1023). Therefore, the voltage detection module detects that the input voltage is 0.00489VÃ—5=0.02445V.
